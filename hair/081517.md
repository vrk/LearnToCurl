## Day 2: 
_August 15, 2017_

❌ Did not wash hair, aside from dry shampoo
✅ Still had to blow dry

### The morning

- I did a bunch of trial runs with the curling iron *off* -- that helped!
- I solved the crinkle hair bug! Basically you have to be careful with 

### The results

- Better curls than yesterday!!
- I think I almost mostly understand how to do the right side of my head. CAN CREATE A TUTORIAL LATER
- Uhh still struggling with the left side of my head?? I'm not sure how to twist the hair around the iron properly on the right side. Will practice this tomorrow.
