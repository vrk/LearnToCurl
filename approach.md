## Theory and Approach

- **As long as it takes**
  - Since I don't have to be at RC by a certain time, I will take as long as possible to do my hairstuffs. I may be coming in the afternoon, folks
  - lol my hairstylist was like "it'll take you 20 minutes at first" MORE LIKE AN HOUR MINIMUM AND IT WILL STILL LOOK LIKE GARBAGE.
- **"I meant to do that"**
  - Depressingly, I'm always attempting to do my [images/goal-hair.jpg](goal hair), but since I cannot achieve that look yet, the I'm willing to settle for "any hairstyle." Meaning, someone should be able to look at my hair and be like "Oh OK, that's a valid hairstyle" and not "Wow what's wrong with that girl's hair?"
  - _Corrolary: Get everything else together_ If I pay more attention to my clothes/makeup, it will look more like I intended to do whatever mess I made of my hair. Like maybe I'm [trying to be this model](http://www.oystermag.com/meet-the-model-clodelle-img). (fyi searching ["messy hair"](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=messy%20hair) on Pinterest returns upsettingly perfect-hair results)
- **Hair tie is last resort**
  - If you see me with my hair tied up in the next 2 weeks, know that I've been defeated.

### The routine

First thing to understand: I'm washing my hair every _other_ day, even if I exercise, since a) my hair stylist told me to wash my hair every other day and b) the [first result on Google said](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/The-post-workout-hair-and-skincare-bible/articleshow/48238191.cms) that I should still do this even if I exercise.

And yes, I will still shower daily.

#### On a hair-wash day:

0. Once a week, use a [hair mask](http://www.garnierusa.com/articles-tips/hair-care/hair-tips/hair-masks-what-are-they-all-about.aspx).
1. Spray hair with **sea salt spray** and treat hair ends **hair oil** while my hair is still wet.
2. **Blow dry** in the morning: My hair stylist told me to "be intentional" with my hair drying. So instead of like, shaking the hair dryer when I dry and blowing my hair all over the place, I'm like, keeping the hair dryer straight down and blow-drying my hair straight-ish. Can do a video maybe.
3. Brush hair and pray
4. Grab hair in triangle-shaped sections and... curl, I guess?
5. Hair spray
6. Do makeup in accordance with state of hair

#### On a non-wash day:

\~The dream\~ is that I do such a great job styling my hair on a wash-day that I wouldn't have to do anything on a non-wash day, other than use dry shampoo. 

But barring that... I guess same steps as before, minus the hair dry part!

### Product list

Yeah yeah some of this is expensive but I AM ON A HAIR JOURNEY
