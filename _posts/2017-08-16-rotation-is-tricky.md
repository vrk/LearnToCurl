## Day 3: 
_August 16, 2017_

✅ Washed hair!  
✅ Blow-dried hair!  
✅ Curled hair!  

### The morning
- TBH I was feeling my pre-curled hair look this morning but I curled it anyway FOR SCIENCE
- So I think the left side turned out \~better\~ than yesterday, but still definitely weirder than the right side! I think it has to do with the angle I'm holding the iron?? Also when I curl the right side of my head, I have a way of doing it without having to let go of my hair (so I can more easily wrap the extra hair around the iron). But on the left side, I need to drop my hair to twist again, which becomes impractical around the back of my hair. I should really take some videos describing what I mean.
- Had the thought today that my look would have been cute if I put my hair half tied up + glasses. Maybe that's my casual Friday look.
- **Homework tomorrow:** Rewatch a curling iron video on youtube and pay special attention to their arm/hand positions

### The results
