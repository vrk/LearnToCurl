## Day 5 or 6: A hair-pair session!!
_August 21, 2017_

✅ Washed hair!  
✅ Blow-dried hair!  
✅ Curled hair with help of Allie!!!

### The morning
OMG so, fellow RCer, computer-and-hair extraordinaire [creviera](https://github.com/creviera) was up on the hair-related GitHub issues, and she offered to pair with me on my left-side issues!

That means Friday morning I came in with straight hair, then creviera and I had an enlightening conversation / demo re: hair curlage.

I recorded it on video for my own reference, and maybe for yours as well!

**How to do a proper curl, by [creviera](https://github.com/creviera)**

creviera also showed me another technique involving a round brush:

### The results

After the incredible tutorial, it was time to actually curl my hair.

SUPER SUCCESSFUL, thanks to creviera's expert coaching:

creviera also snapped some preeeeetty great in-progress photos:

(LOL @ my face in that first pic)

**Learnings**
- On the right side, the clampy part of the curling iron should face downward so I don't have to cross my arms when curling
- On the left side, the CONAIR logo should show outward toward the mirror
- Curling smaller clumps means less risk when messing up (since it means only a small clump will be wonky)
- My front hair fronds should be curled slightly differently than the rest of the fronds.

### Selfie

I didn't selfie on Friday, but ON SATURDAY, my hair looked *great*. I was going to exercise on Saturday but skipped it because hair too good.

This is a dramatic self-portrait from Saturday, to give you a sense of my hair-wise satisfaction:
