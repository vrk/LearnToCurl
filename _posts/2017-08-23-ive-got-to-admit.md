## Day 7: I've got to admit
_August 23, 2017_

IT'S GETTING BETTER.

### Daily hair overview

❌ Did not wash hair, aside from dry shampoo  
✅ Blow-dried hair a little from residual shower wetness. Maybe I need a [fun shower cap](http://www.yesstyle.com/en/homy-bazaar-cartoon-print-shower-cap/info.html/pid.1057131102)  
✅ Curled my hair and felt great about it  
✅ I've added this [treatment oil](https://us.neoncoproducts.com/product/treatment-oil) from Neon&Co to my routine! Discovered through the pop-up at [Canal St Market](http://canalstreet.market/).

### The morning

WHO KNEW that practicing a thing can make you better at that thing?

Honestly though, isn't is amazing how just mindlessly repeating an action without really thinking about it can still make you better at it? Esp when you're starting from as meager a start-state as I! Humans, man.

Curling is getting slightly faster and easier! It takes less thinking to get my hands all in position, and I'm getting better at sectioning my hair, etc. And I think I can safely resolve [this issue](https://github.com/vrk/LearnToCurl/issues/1)!

Sometimes the curling iron gets stuck in my a little when I'm twirling (whiiiiich is always terrifying), and I'm still never totally sure what my hair is going to look like after I'm done, so there's that to still figure out. It's startling right after I've finished curling my hair because my hair gets SO BIG, esp after brushing out the curls! But then it seems to deflate a bit by the time I reach RC, happily.

### The results

Loving my [DRAM shirt](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/big-baby-dram-tee) btw

**Learnings**
- OMG if you want to wear a necklace that has a tricky clasp, *put it on before* getting your hands all covered in hair product oils.
- Hair will be MAX VOLUME / bigness right after curling + brushing out. But it'll settle down to something more normal within the hour!

### Selfie

I might redo this selfie with less bad lighting.
